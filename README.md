### Troubleshooting
- **TypeError: Object of type date/datetime is not JSON serializable:**
  - All date/datetime fields are now converted to ISO strings before logging. If you see this error, update your code as shown in the latest version.
- **NameError: name 'log_user_input' is not defined:**
  - Ensure the `log_user_input` function is defined at the top of `streamlit_app.py` after all imports.
